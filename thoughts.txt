1. Buy Wins --> Buy Points/gameweek
2. There are two ways to win. 
    a) Most points over an entire season.
    b) More points than the person you are playing per game week.
3. Constraints:
    a) $100,000 to spend for 14 players.
    b) 2 goalkeepers
    c) No more than 3 players from the same team
    d) You must field 1 goalkeeper, 3,4,5,6 defenders, 3,4,5,6, midfielders, 0,1,2,3,4 fowards
    e) 11 players must play per week.

With respect to 1.  Begin with the maximum points earned in the last season, divide that by 38 gameweeks.
This value is the target points per gameweek gV (tV).  We want to generate tV per gameweek.  This won't
be possible to get every gameweek.

4. Considerations:
    a) Propensity for injury? --> this has an effect on points generated in a year
    b) Propensity for yellow/red cards --> this has an effect on points generated in a year
    c) Ignore triple captain.  It would be difficult to try an account for this.
        Perhaps this can be added in a special gameweek hand manipulated based on
        a strong team playing a weak team.
    d) Consider trades if injuries occur.

5. What gives points?
    a) Playing up to 60 minutes                       -  1 point
    b) Playing 60 minutes or more                     -  2 points
    c) Goal scored by gk or defender                  -  6 points 
    d) Goal scored by a midfielder                    -  5 points
    e) Goal scored by a forward                       -  4 points
    f) For each of assist for a goal                  -  6 points
    g) For a clean sheet by a gk or defender          -  4 points
    h) For a clean sheet by a midfielder              -  1 point
    i) For every 3 shots saved by a gk                -  1 point/ 3 saves
    j) For each penalty save                          -  5 points
    k) For each penalty miss                          - -2 points
    l) Bonus points for the best players in a match   - b/w 1-3 points
    m) For every 2 goals conceded by a gk or defender - -1 points
    n) For each yellow card                           - -1 points
    o) For each red card                              - -3 points
    p) For each own goal                              - -2 points

6. What is a good predictor of points?
    a) playing time?
    b) exp goals?
    c) time in the opponents 3rd
    d) number of passes?
    e) style of play?
    f) money spent by club?
