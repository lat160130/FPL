This text file contains thoughts on what could possibly predict next season point results for each player.


Goalkeepers:
Age, points last season, points their defenders scored last season, shutouts in their career, number of injuries in career.


Field Players:
Age, points last season, number of injuries in career, number of wins, team arriving at, likely bench or starter.


Create a linear regression model that tries to accurately predict points based on the above variables.

Interesting ideas:

PCA to try and grab the important variables.
If possible do NOT purchase above the age of 32 unless they are goalkeepers, exceptions could be made for defenders based on their team and experience.
